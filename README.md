# GifTastic

**Description:**

The purpose of this assignment was to use giphy API to display gifs based on a selected theme. Pre-chosen gif theme buttons are displayed at the top of the page. The user can add their own theme button to the list. When the user presses a theme button, the application displays 10 gifs based on the selected theme. When displayed, the gifs are still images. The user may click on the gif to animate. When the user clicks on the animated gif, it reverts to a still image.

The user may also display more gifs by pressing the "Give me more!" button. The application will prepend an additional 10 gifs. When the user selects a different theme, the current displayed gifs are cleared and the new theme gifs are displayed.

**Notes**
Added a hover border around the gif images to indicate which gif is currently selected.
